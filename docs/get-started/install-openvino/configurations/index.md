# Additional Configurations

> to work with Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit.

For certain use cases, you may need to install additional software, to benefit from the full
potential of OpenVINO™. Check the following list for components used in your workflow:

**GPU drivers**  
  If you want to run inference on a GPU, make sure your GPU's drivers are properly installed. See the \[guide on GPU configuration\](configurations/configurations-intel-gpu.md) for details.

**NPU drivers**  
  Intel's Neural Processing Unit introduced with the Intel® Core™ Ultra generation of CPUs (formerly known as Meteor Lake), is a low-power solution for offloading neural network computation. If you want to run inference on an NPU, make sure your NPU's drivers are properly installed. See the \[guide on NPU configuration\](configurations/configurations-intel-npu.md) for details.

**OpenVINO GenAI Dependencies**  
  OpenVINO GenAI is a tool based on the OpenVNO Runtime but simplifying the process of running generative AI models. For information on the dependencies required to use OpenVINO GenAI, see the \[guide on OpenVINO GenAI Dependencies\](configurations/genai-dependencies.md).

**Open Computer Vision Library**  
  OpenCV is used to extend the capabilities of some models, for example enhance some of OpenVINO samples, when used as a dependency in compilation. To install OpenCV for OpenVINO, see the [instructions on GtHub](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/BuildOpenCV4OpenVINO).
