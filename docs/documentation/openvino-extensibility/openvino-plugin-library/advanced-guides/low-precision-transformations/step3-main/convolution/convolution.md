# ConvolutionTransformation transformation

ov::pass::low\_precision::ConvolutionTransformation class represents the Convolution operation transformation.

The transformation propagates dequantization operations on activations and weights through the Convolution operation. The transformation supports several weights quantization approaches:

  - quantized weights in low precision with dequantization operations,
  - weights in original precision with FakeQuantize operation.

Result dequantization `Multiply` constant value *result* is calculated as multiplication for dequantization Multiply constant value on activations *a* and dequantization Multiply constant value on weights *b* :

\[result_\{i\} = a_\{i\} \cdot b_\{i\}\]

## Limitations

  - Dequantization on activations must be per-tensor. It means that dequantization Multiply constant value on activations must be scalar.
