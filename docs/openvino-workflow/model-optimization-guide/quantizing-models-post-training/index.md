# Post-training Quantization

Post-training quantization is a method of reducing the size of a model, to make it lighter,
faster, and less resource hungry. Importantly, this process does not require retraining,
fine-tuning, or using training datasets and pipelines in the source framework. With NNCF, you
can perform [8-bit quantization](#why-8-bit-post-training-quantization), using mainly the two
flows:

\[Basic quantization (simple)\](quantizing-models-post-training/basic-quantization-flow.md):  
    Requires only a representative calibration dataset.

\[Accuracy-aware Quantization (advanced)\](quantizing-models-post-training/quantizing-with-accuracy-control.md):  
    Ensures the accuracy of the resulting model does not drop below a certain value. To do so, it requires both a calibration and a validation datasets, as well as a validation function to calculate the accuracy metric.

## Why 8-bit post-training quantization

The 8-bit quantization is just one of the available compression methods but one often
selected for:

  - significant performance results,
  - little impact on accuracy,
  - ease of use,
  - wide hardware compatibility.

It lowers model weight and activation precisions to 8 bits (INT8), which for an FP64 model
is just a quarter of the original footprint, leading to a significant improvement in inference
speed.
